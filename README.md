# Iris-Flower-classification
The Iris Flower classification is a classic and popular machine learning project. The project aims to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their specific features, namely 'Sepal length', 'Sepal width', 'Petal length', and 'Petal width'. The dataset used for this project contains measurements of 50 samples from each of the three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor.

The main objective of this project is to build a model that can learn from the provided data and then accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its feature measurements.
